#  My First Complete Website

This is my first fully built website project — crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and styled using Tailwind CSS. I used **Vite** as my development environment for blazing-fast performance and a smooth dev experience. I practiced working with **branches** to organize my features and structure my workflow like a real-world developer.

## Features

- Responsive and modern UI
- Tailwind CSS for sleek and utility-first styling
- Organized file structure
- Interactive elements using JavaScript
- Built with Vite for fast builds and hot-reloading
- Branching used to separate features and bug fixes

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** – Frontend tooling
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control & collaboration

##  Branching Workflow

I followed a basic Git branching model:
- `main` – stable production-ready code
- `feature/*` – for developing new features
- `bugfix/*` – for fixing issues

##  How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name
